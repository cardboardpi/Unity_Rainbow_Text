# Unity_Rainbow_Text
Here is the code from a video I did on youtube

The V1 is for the simplified gradient effect

The V2 is for the blending between a character, so that a character has 2 colors, one on its left vertices and one on its right vertices.

The V3 is for specifiying a string that you want to have the rainbow effect

The V4 is for multiple of the same string that you want to have the rainbow effect, you can also have it be case Insensitive or not. (Kinda buggy but use it at your own discretion).
